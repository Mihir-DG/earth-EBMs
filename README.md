# earth-EBMs
A hierarchial set of energy balance models parameterized for the Earth system using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs (RRTM-G) as implemented in climt using Python.

#### Models:

a) 0D Radiative Equilibrium

b) 1D Radiative Equilibrium

c) 1D Radiative-Convective Equilibrium
